1. Run the program with various arguments:
   ./cub3D
   ./cub3D map.cub extra_arg
   ./cub3D nonexistent_file.cub
   ./cub3D invalid_extension.txt

2. Check for memory leaks:
   valgrind --leak-check=full ./cub3D valid_map.cub

3. Test input resilience:
   - Run the game with a valid map
   - Press multiple keys simultaneously
   - Rapidly alternate between different movement keys
   - Hold down movement keys for extended periods

4. Modify the map file:
   a. Valid modifications:
      - Change the player's starting position
      - Alter the maze layout (ensuring it remains valid)
      - Modify texture paths to other valid .xpm files
      - Change floor and ceiling colors

   b. Invalid modifications:
      - Remove a required texture path
      - Use an invalid color value (e.g., 256,0,0)
      - Create an unclosed map (remove some border walls)
      - Add multiple player starting positions
      - Include invalid characters in the map

5. Test texture file handling:
   - Modify texture paths to non-existent files
   - Use invalid file extensions for textures

6. Test color parsing:
   - Use invalid color formats (e.g., missing components, non-numeric values)
   - Test edge cases (0,0,0 and 255,255,255)

7. Map validation:
   - Test with maps of various sizes (minimum size, very large)
   - Create maps with irregular shapes
   - Test maps with and without spaces around walls

8. Player position:
   - Test maps with player in different positions (corners, center)
   - Create a map without a player position

9. File handling:
   - Test with a read-only .cub file
   - Test with a very large .cub file

10. Error messages:
    - Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for each failure case

For each test, run the program and observe its behavior. It should either run correctly or exit with an appropriate error message, without crashing or exhibiting undefined behavior.
